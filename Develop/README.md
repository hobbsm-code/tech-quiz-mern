# Tech Quiz Application

## Description
This project is a MERN stack application that allows users to take a quiz on various tech topics. The application will display a question and multiple choice answers. The user will select an answer and submit it. The application will then display the correct answer and the user's score. The user can then move on to the next question. The application will keep track of the user's score and display it at the end of the quiz.

This application was created by the edX team as part of the edX Full Stack Developer Bootcamp. Cypress tests were added to the application to test the functionality of the application.
